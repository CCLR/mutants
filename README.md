# DNA sequence mutant detector

Given a matrix of strings representing each row of a table (NxN) with the DNA sequence, a human is a mutant if it finds more than one configuration of identical four-letter strings, obliquely, horizontally or vertically.

The program will store the verified sequences, returning a 200 if mutant or a 403 if human.

It also has an extra service that exposes the ratio of mutants to humans.
